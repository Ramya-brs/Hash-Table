## ABOUT HASH-TABLE
A Hash Table is a data structure that provides efficient data retrieval and insertion operations. 
It is also known as a Hash Map or Dictionary in some programming languages. Hash Tables are based on the concept of hashing, where data is stored and accessed using a unique key. 
This key is hashed into an index, allowing for constant-time (O(1)) access to elements.
